implementation_patterns:
  - pattern: "Token Streaming"
    description: "Stream tokens for faster response"
    code_example: |
      async for token in model.stream(prompt):
          yield token

  - pattern: "Batch Processing"
    description: "Process multiple prompts efficiently"
    code_example: |
      results = model.generate_batch(prompts, batch_size=16)
