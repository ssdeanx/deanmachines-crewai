# Software Planning MCP Tool: Detailed Notes & Usage Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the available tools for managing software development plans, including their detailed usage and JSON schemas. This guide is intended for use with AI assistants like Copilot, focusing on functionality rather than specific examples.

---

## Available Tools (6)

### 1. `start_planning`

**Function**: This tool initializes a new, empty planning session focused on a specific software development objective. It serves as the starting point for creating a structured plan, clearing any previous session data.

**Usage**: Execute this command **once** at the very beginning of a new planning initiative. It establishes the scope and primary objective (`goal`) for the entire session. Any subsequent `add_todo` calls will be associated with this goal. Calling `start_planning` again will typically discard the current plan and begin a fresh one.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `goal` (`string`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: Clearly defines the primary objective or desired outcome for this specific software plan. Guides the subsequent breakdown into tasks.

*   **Expected Outcome**: The planning session is initialized with the specified goal. The internal state is reset, ready for tasks to be added. A confirmation message indicating the session has started with the given goal is typical.

---

### 2. `add_todo`

**Function**: This tool adds a single, actionable task (a todo item) to the currently active plan. It's the core mechanism for populating the plan with detailed steps required to achieve the overall `goal`.

**Usage**: Call this tool repeatedly after `start_planning` to break down the high-level `goal` into concrete, manageable tasks. Each task should be specific enough to be assigned and completed. Consider the `complexity` score carefully for prioritization and estimation. The `description` should contain sufficient detail for someone to execute the task. The system will assign a unique `todoId` internally upon creation.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `title` (`string`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: A concise and easily scannable summary identifying the task.
    *   `description` (`string`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: Provides detailed context, requirements, acceptance criteria, or steps necessary for completing the task effectively. Should be clear for the implementer.
    *   `complexity` (`number`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: A numerical estimate (0-10) of the task's difficulty, effort, or uncertainty. Aids in prioritization and workload planning. (0=trivial, 10=very complex).
    *   `codeExample` (`string`, *optional*):
        *   **Description**: An optional snippet of code, configuration, data structure, or command illustrating a technical detail or approach relevant to the task.

*   **Expected Outcome**: A new todo item is added to the current plan's list. A confirmation message, possibly including the newly assigned unique `todoId` for the added task, is often returned. The internal list of todos managed by the session is updated.

---

### 3. `get_todos`

**Function**: This tool retrieves the complete list of all todo items currently associated with the active planning session, including their status and details.

**Usage**: Use this frequently to review the plan's progress, identify remaining work, and find the specific `todoId` required for `update_todo_status` or `remove_todo`. It provides a snapshot of the entire task list at the time of execution. Useful before planning meetings or status updates.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   *None*.

*   **Expected Output**: Returns a structured collection (commonly an array) of objects. Each object represents a single todo item and contains key-value pairs detailing its properties:
    *   `todoId` (`string`): The unique identifier for the task.
    *   `title` (`string`): The task's title.
    *   `description` (`string`): The detailed description.
    *   `complexity` (`number`): The assigned complexity score.
    *   `codeExample` (`string`, possibly null/absent): The optional code example, if provided.
    *   `isComplete` (`boolean`): The current completion status of the task.
    If no todos exist in the plan, it should return an empty collection.

### 4. `update_todo_status`

**Function**: This tool modifies the completion status (`true` or `false`) of a specified todo item within the plan using its unique identifier.

**Usage**: Call this tool whenever a task's completion state changes. Typically used to mark a task as done (`isComplete: true`) upon completion or to reopen a task (`isComplete: false`) if issues are found or further work is needed. You must provide the correct `todoId` obtained from `get_todos` or from the output of `add_todo`.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `todoId` (`string`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: The unique identifier specifying which todo item's status should be updated.
    *   `isComplete` (`boolean`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: The target completion state for the specified todo item (`true` indicates completed, `false` indicates not completed).

*   **Expected Outcome**: The specified todo item's `isComplete` status is updated within the plan's internal state. A confirmation message indicating the successful update for the given `todoId` is expected. An error may occur if the `todoId` is not found.

---

### 5. `remove_todo`

**Function**: This tool permanently deletes a specific todo item from the active plan using its unique identifier.

**Usage**: Use this tool carefully when a task is genuinely no longer needed (e.g., requirement changes, duplication, merged into another task). Deletion is typically permanent. You must provide the correct `todoId` obtained from `get_todos`.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `todoId` (`string`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: The unique identifier specifying which todo item should be removed from the plan.

*   **Expected Outcome**: The specified todo item is permanently removed from the plan's list. A confirmation message indicating successful removal for the given `todoId` is expected. An error may occur if the `todoId` is not found.

---

### 6. `save_plan`

**Function**: This tool saves a block of text representing an overall summary, narrative, or high-level description associated with the current plan. It is distinct from managing the individual todo items.

**Usage**: Use this tool to persist contextual information that complements the structured task list. This could include the overall strategy, architectural decisions, links to design documents, meeting summaries, or risk assessments related to the `goal`. It allows saving a free-form text document alongside the task management functions. It does *not* affect the individual todo items managed by other commands.

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `plan` (`string`, **required**):
        *   **Description**: The textual content (plain text, Markdown, etc.) to be saved as the plan's narrative description or summary.

*   **Expected Outcome**: The provided text content is saved or persisted by the underlying system (e.g., written to a file, stored in a database). A confirmation message indicating that the plan text has been saved successfully is expected.
