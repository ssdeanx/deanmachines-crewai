# Project Progress

## Completed Features
- ✅ Implemented Gemini crew with proper error handling and tools
- ✅ Implemented LM Studio crew with OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- ✅ Created shared tool infrastructure with ToolFactory
- ✅ Added MLflow integration for both models
- ✅ Implemented proper logging and error handling

## Current Status
- Both Gemini and LM Studio crews are ready for use
- Tools infrastructure is in place with web search, file analysis, and knowledge base tools
- MLflow tracking is configured for model performance comparison

## Next Steps
1. Complete knowledge base tool implementation for better information sharing
2. Enhance validation and testing tools
3. Implement advanced analysis and insight generation features
4. Add parallel execution support for model comparison
5. Implement proper MLflow metrics tracking with PostgreSQL backend correctly integrated
6. Enhance agent memory configuration with proper 1M token context window support
7. Implement efficient parallel processing between Gemini Flash and LM Studio models
8. Add selenium search tool integration with proper error handling and retries
9. Complete structured thinking implementation with new Gemini 2.0 experimental thinking mode
10. Update code execution capabilities to utilize Gemini Flash's native code execution
11. Create proper knowledge base structure for sharing context between models
12. Add proper model fallback logic between Flash and LM Studio
13. Implement config validation to ensure environment variables are properly set
14. Add performance monitoring dashboard for real-time model comparison

## Usage
To run analysis with either model:
```bash
python -m src.ollama.main --model gemini --topic "Your topic"
# or
python -m src.ollama.main --model lmstudio --topic "Your topic"
```

## Environment Setup
1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Set GEMINI_API_KEY for Gemini usage
3. Configure LM Studio endpoint (default: http://localhost:1234)
4. Start MLflow server with PostgreSQL backend
5. Set required environment variables:
   - MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI
   - GEMINI_API_KEY
   - LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
6. Configure LM Studio (optional):
   - LMSTUDIO_API_URL
   - LMSTUDIO_MODEL

## Required Dependencies
```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install crewai langchain langgraph mlflow psycopg2-binary selenium
# Additional tools
pip install google-generativeai pillow python-dotenv pyyaml requests webdriver-manager
```
